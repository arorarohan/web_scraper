# web_scraper
Being a moron, I decided to build a web scraper. This isn't going to go well, and I really don't know what I am doing or what I even need to know in order to make this. I don't even really know what a web scraper does or what I'm going to 'scrape' for. Well, whatever.

## the approach
1. fuck around (i.e. do something I have zero understanding of, which is probably well out of my depth)

## the goal
1. find out (i.e. learn new stuff, improve my skills or whatever)
